### Description

Sometimes you've got something with USB host, like a embedded linux board, and you want to connect more than one thing. Or maybe you want to turn something like a keyboard into a multi-device USB peripheral. The Adafruit CH334F Mini 4-Port USB Hub Breakout will do that for you! it features a CH334F USB 2.1 hub chip which converts one high-speed port into four.

Most folks who use a USB hub get one that comes in an enclosure with connectors or cables included. But, those hubs are going to be bulky - they're meant for external use. This breakout board is designed to be compact, so it can easily be embedded into an enclosure or existing device. There's four mounting holes but other than that, we tried to keep it as compact as possible.

Part of how we kept it small is not including downstream ports! The breakout has either 0.1" header or USB C for the upstream, and then four 4-pin ports for peripheral connections. We expect folks to solder directly to the pads or use our 'simple' USB-breakout cables.

You get one fully assembled/tested boards and some extra header if you happen to want to plug it into a breadboard. Other than that, just keep in mind there's no USB ports for the 4 downstreams - if you need those take a look at some of the other hubs we stock.
